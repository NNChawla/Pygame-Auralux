Orbit Exit Collisions:
-When units were exiting orbit they'd collide with backside of planet and be reset; They should've avoided it or
been relocated to the other side.

Movement:
-Units should have moved in a cloud rather than one pixel

Level Design:
-Should have been designed levels and procedurally generated level options

Planet Placement:
-Planets should have been able to be placed within confines of screen without hitting each other
