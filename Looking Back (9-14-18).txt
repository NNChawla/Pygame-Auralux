Orbit Exit Collisions:
-When units were exiting orbit they'd collide with backside of planet and be reset; They should've avoided it or
been relocated to the other side.

Movement:
-Units should have moved in a cloud rather than one pixel

Level Design:
-Should have been designed levels and procedurally generated level options

Planet Placement:
-Planets should have been able to be placed within confines of screen without hitting each other

Networking:
-Local/Online Multiplayer should have been developed

Player Specific Control:
-Player should only be able to move their units

AI
-Computer controlled enemy should exist; Dartmouth paper on auralux AI is useful in this case

Upgrades
-multiple upgrades listed in mechanics breakdown; their implementations would be interesting
