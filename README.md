# Pygame-Auralux

This was my attempt at recreating my favorite mobile game "Auralux" using pygame. I started and stopped working on this over a weeklong Thanksgiving break in 2017, exclusivley writing it from my laptop in the car while traveling Arizona with my family. It was difficult to keep a coherent thought but I really enjoyed working on this so I managed to put something together. It's not particularly robust, but I'm positive that with dedicated time, in an environment more stable than a hot car packed with family members, this can be revamped into something neat. I intend to return to this when I have the time, which is hopefully sometime in the near future, but either way it was a really fun learning experience.
